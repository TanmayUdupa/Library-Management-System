# Library-Management-System

Many lbraries have a library system to add books, search books and to maintain information about the borrowed books. I have tried to create a simple version of this system using C++.

The main user of this system is the admin of the library. The admin can do the following:

1) Add books
2) Search a book
3) Display library members who have borrowed a particular book
4) Display details of the books in the library in ascending order of their IDs
5) Display details of the books in the library in alphabetical order
6) Add a library member
7) Update the system when a library member has borrowed a book
8) Update the system when a library member has returned a book
9) Display list of all books borrowed by a member
10) Display all members in ascending order of their IDs
11) Display all library members in alphabetical order of their names
